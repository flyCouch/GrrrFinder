GrrrFinder.

A multifunction tool whose primary purpose is to help you find "Grrr(s)".

It's a bit of humor and an educating project.

Watch out for those Grrrs!

This will help you find them before they find you.

"Mom! The Emperor has no clothes!!"


This is also a test platform to build a 3-Pin Operating System.

1 Analog IN and 2 Digital INs.

This is just the beginning of a long-term, low effort project.


Some Irritating Fucks who have access to My Mind are making me add, truthfully, these aren't useful measurements (for reasons) and they are for Amusement Purposes Only.

And I go to feed the Pigeons.

And even if truly useful, the results would require a Degree's worth of training to get understanding. I am not stopped from looking though. Who wants to fight Me?

Wah wah wah, And No Medical Advice will be Implied or Given. Fuck Right Off and find an Actual M.D., there's your advice!


Yours Truly,
