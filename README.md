GrrrFinder

A multifunction tool whose primary purpose is to help you find "Grrr(s)".

It's a bit of humor and a educating project.

Watch out for those Grrs!

This will help you find them before they find you.

"Mom! The Emperor has no clothes!!"


This is also a test platform to build a 3-Pin Operating System.

1 Analog IN and 2 Digital INs.

This is just the beginning of a long-term, low effort project.
